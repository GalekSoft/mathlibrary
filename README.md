# Galek MathLibrary

This math library was based on AST math library and was rewritten by me from scratch for my personal student project. If you can - use GLM, previously me not satisfied API of GLM, and was written this library.My main goal when I was developing this library was to get experience with new technologies and some specific features (as SIMD)

Years of active development: 2009-2016.

# TODO:

  - Actual of SIMD support for mobile and PC platforms
  - Extend API and math functionally
  - More tests
  - Doxygen documentation
